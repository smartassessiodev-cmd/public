# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in SmartAssess.io.

This public repository is **documentation-first**. Production code and internal systems are intentionally kept private.

---

## What we accept right now

✅ Documentation improvements  
✅ UX/accessibility suggestions  
✅ Roadmap feedback and feature ideas  
✅ Assessment design feedback (what makes a question fair, clear, and meaningful)

---

## What we do NOT accept (for now)

❌ Pull requests to production code (not in this repo)  
❌ Requests for database credentials or internal access  
❌ “Just add everything to open source” pushes

We’re open — but we’re also protecting the project while it’s early.

## How to contribute

### Option A: Open an Issue (preferred)
- Bug/typo in docs
- Suggestion for roadmap
- UX notes
- Assessment ideas

### Option B: Submit a Pull Request
Small, focused PRs are best:
- Fix wording / typos
- Add clarity to docs
- Improve structure

---

## Guidelines

- Keep it simple and direct
- Avoid hype or fluff
- Prefer clarity over clever wording
- Be respectful — critiques are welcome, disrespect isn’t

---

## Security

If you find something that looks like a security issue:
- **Do not post it publicly**
- Instead, open an issue titled: **“Security Concern”** with minimal detail
- We’ll follow up from there
